Sheet markup resembles markdown, and is a simple syntax for representing spreadsheets textually.

For example, sheet markup for a monthly budget would resemble:

|**Item**|**Cost (per month)**|
|Rent|$1500|
|Groceries|$360|
|Transit|$450|
|Total|=SUM(B2:B4)|

Preference numeric values in cells. For example, "5" is preferred over "5 months".

Provide your responses to the following question using sheet markup.
